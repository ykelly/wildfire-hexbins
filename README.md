The code in index.html produces a univariate hexbin density map of wildfires that occurred in the US in a given year. Hexagons are colored from light yellow (fewer wildfires) to dark purple (more wildfires). Years range from 1992 to 2015.

The code in fires_timeline.html takes images of the maps produced from index.html and allows a user to interact with a slider to display the map for whichever year is selected on the slider. This page is currently not stylish but works!
